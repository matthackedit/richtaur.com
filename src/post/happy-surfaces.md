As discussed in [Lostcast 246: Penultimania](http://www.lostdecadegames.com/lostcast-246/), sometimes when I'm trying to draw a scene I have a difficult time filling the space. The blank page (or canvas) can be intimidating and without much to guide me I often get lost or stumble along the way.

Recently I tried an approach where I began with an arbitrary 3d structure before sketching out the scene. The structure helped guide the drawing, ensured a decent composition, and gave me a kind of visual progress bar as I went.

First I drew out a 3d structure. My goal here was to establish perspective and fill the space with a satisfying composition.

Once I had my lines laid down, I filled the volume with a midtone and shaded certain planes to ensure I still liked the structure when it was rendered out a little more.

Sketching was really easy at this point because the flat surfaces were so inviting. The very first thing I did was hang that lizard in the upper-left and the rest flowed from there. As I filled the surfaces with drawings, I could easily see how many surfaces were left to fill and it gave me energy to continue drawing.

Pieces like this have given me a hard time in the past. The promotional material for A Wizard's Lizard, for example, looks worse and took more out of me to finish. Structures like this can provide stability

Next: I need to work on my line weight. Line thickness is all over the place in this drawing and in the future I'll try to intentionally utilize line weight to help
