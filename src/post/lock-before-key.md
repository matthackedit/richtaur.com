_Here's a recent addition to [My Game Design Principles](/post/game-design-principles/):_

Present the player with the **lock** before the **key** to open it. A key without context is just trash. "What's this key for? I don't need it."

A lock can be intriguing. "What’s behind that door? What’s inside that chest?" Locks ask questions that only keys can answer.

Locks can take many forms: impassable rivers, high cliffs, invulnerable monsters. Keys also: rafts, jumping boots, flaming swords. Provide the need before the solution.

[Repeat after me, lock before key.](http://howtomakeanrpg.com/a/how-zelda-gets-lock-and-key-puzzles-right.html)
