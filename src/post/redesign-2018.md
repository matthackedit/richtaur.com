Why redesign *richtaur.com*?

In 2017, I thought it would be a good idea to require all posts to have their own title and thumbnails images. While I do prefer visual interest, *requiring* an image ended up making me post less often.

Sometimes people just want to type, ya know? This is true for me, too, even though I like to draw and create images.

Requiring post images probably came from a desire to force myself to draw more. But tangling that up with my desire to write wasn't a good idea. Multitasking is the enemy of the modern creator (something I will write more about soon).

So here's to untethered creativity and keeping it simple.

*(Fun fact: most of this site's incarnations from previous years can be found in the new sidebar, dating all the way back to 2010.)*
